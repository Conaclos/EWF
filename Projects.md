## Evaluate EWF according to the following constraints ... 
* _Suggested by **Javier**_
* See http://www.amundsen.com/blog/archives/1130
* Other option is take the following REST implementation toolkit as a guide to evaluate EWF http://code.google.com/p/implementing-rest/wiki/RESTImplementationToolkit.

## Road to Hypermedia API

   - blog
   - template / theme
   - persistency / storage / ...
   - extension at compilation time

## Build P2P connector
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* Imagine you want to publish a website running on your machine (behing firewall). One would need to initiate the connection via a public website, this is common for P2P software such as remote assistance (i.e: join.me, teamviewer, showmypc, ...)

# Libraries

## Hypermedia API library to work with XHTML 
* _Suggested by **Javier**_
* http://codeartisan.blogspot.com.ar/2012/07/using-html-as-media-type-for-your-api.html

## Add support for Mediatype such as RSS, ATOM, ...
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* Being able to generate, and also consume RSS, ATOM, ...

## Security: provide popular authentication mecanisms

* OAuth: consumer and provider
* OpenID
* Google Connect
* Facebook Connect
* ...

## Design a state machine to serve response
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* example: multipage web form

## library: Template engine
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* Get inspired by any existing template engine, and build one for Eiffel
  - http://www.smarty.net/
  - http://mustache.github.com/
  - ...
* This is not specific to EWF, but it will be very useful in website context

## library: Wikitext, markdown parser and renderer
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* Support reading of wikitext, and markdown, and provide HTML rendering
* extension: render wikitext and markdown into Vision2 widget (not related to EWF, but could be useful to build editor)

## library: Web component to build HTML5 widget
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* Build set of Eiffel component to ease development of websites
  - table widget (with sorting ...)
  - suggestive typing widget
  - tab ...
  - WYSIWYG textarea widget (could reuse existing JS solution ...)
  - ...



# Clients

## Libraries: Reusable Client Design based on J.Moore Presentation 
* _Suggested by **Javier**_
* Generic client that can be customized (see design in slide 12)
* http://s3.amazonaws.com/cimlabs/Oredev-Hypermedia-APIs.pdf
* video http://vimeo.com/20781278

## Create a Client Cache based on Apache commons Client Cache. 
* _Suggested by **Javier**_
* http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient-cache/index.html
* http://labs.xfinity.com/benchmarking-the-httpclient-caching-module

## Add SSL support to Eiffel Net
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn**_
* Currently Eiffel Net does not provide any support to SSL (thus no HTTPS). For now Eiffel application often use the Eiffel cURL wrapper, but it would be more convenient to use directly Eiffel Net.

## Build clients to consume popular RESTful APIs 
* _Suggested by **Jocelyn & Javier**_
* **Requirement**: OAuth client eiffel component
* Google Discovery APIs
* Twitter
* Facebook
* Github
* Flickr
* ... etc
* This should reuse and improve the "http_client" provided by EWF. Eventually also write the EiffelNet implementation to be independant from cURL
