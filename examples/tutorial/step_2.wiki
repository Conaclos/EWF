= Tutorial Step 2 =
* '''Goal''': Build a simple Hello World application
* '''Requirements''': 
** know how to compile with Eiffel (EiffelStudio).
** [[step_1.wiki|Previous step]] completed


== Create "hello" project ==
=== From the archive ===
- to be completed

=== From the source ===
- Requirement: install git on your machine  (http://www.git-scm.org/)

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/EiffelWebFramework/EWF.git ewf

== Install EWF ==
For now, there is nothing specific to do.

(Note: if you want to use the "http_client" library, you will need to do a few extra steps to eventually compile Eiffel Curl.)
