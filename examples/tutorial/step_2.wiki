= Tutorial Step 2 =
* '''Goal''': Build a simple Hello World application
* '''Requirements''': 
** know how to compile with Eiffel (EiffelStudio).
** [[step_1.wiki|Previous step]] completed


== "hello" project ==
* using the "wsf" library:
** It provides service, request, response, ...
* using the "default_nino" library
** This is used to build the application in a portable manner, but for this compilation, it uses Eiffel Web Nino as connector.
** We use Eiffel Web Nino for this tutorial, because there is no need to configure any apache, iis, and so on. And it is convenient to execute inside EiffelStudio

* You will find inside [[step_2]] the "hello" project
** target "hello" provides a very simple implementation (But by default, it is using port 80 with Eiffel Web Nino, which might already be busy by other application)
** target "hello_custom" which uses almost the same code, but in addition, you can use the ewf.ini file to precise the port number (9999 for this example)
