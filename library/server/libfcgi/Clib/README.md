On Windows

The Eiffel libFCGI wrapper needs a modified version of libFCGI (provided by http://www.fastcgi.com/devkit/libfcgi/)

To get the source code, please use the script : get_libfcgi_source.bat
And then to build the needed .dll and .lib file, use either build_win32.bat or build_win64.bat

Hope this helps
